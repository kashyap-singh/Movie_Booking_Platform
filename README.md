# Movie_Booking_Platform

The platform is going to list all the
movies that are currently showing in the cinemas. Users would be able to
get a list of multiple theaters for each movie screening & choose no. of
seats they require. The list of movies could be filtered based on date of
screening & name. Once selected their booking would be confirmed &
which they can find under their own profile. The user profile is going to
contain their name & tickets they have booked. Only administrators would
be able to add movies & list of theaters
